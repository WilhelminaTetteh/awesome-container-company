# Awesome Container Company

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## About Apiary

This Apiary project involves creating a site for the Awesome Container Company, whose mission is to eliminate plastic and single use packaging in the food and beverage industry. To achieve that aim, they provide logistics to companies through their app. Now they need a website to attract new clients and launch their service.
